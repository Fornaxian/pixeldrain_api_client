# pixeldrain_api_client

Client for the pixeldrain API. Used by pixeldrain itself for tranferring data
between the web UI and API server. And for rendering JSON responses.

The structs defined in this package are the real structs that the API server
uses to render its JSON responses, so they are guaranteed to up up-to-date.
